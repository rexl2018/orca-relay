name: configure-orca-relay-clients
description: End-to-end agent runbook for a new user who needs Orca runtime + Orca Relay on a development host, a personal VPS relay path, and Win/Mac/Mobile pairing-code clients. Use when the user asks how to set up orca server with orca-relay, how to pair through a personal VPS, how agents should configure mobile/desktop clients, or when deploy-orca-relay alone is not enough because clients still cannot pair.

# Configure Orca server + Orca Relay for clients

You are configuring the **full remote-access path**, not only the VPS relay binary.

```text
Win / Mac / Mobile / remote CLI
        |
        |  pairing code (endpoint only is rewritten for relay)
        v
[public or local] orca-relay-proxy
        |
        |  adapter frames + shared ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN
        v
personal VPS: orca-relay  (/health, /ws behind TLS)
        |
        v
orca-relay-bridge  (role=server)
        |
        v
development host: orca serve / Orca runtime WebSocket
```

Read this skill **before inventing steps**. If the VPS relay is not installed yet, finish
`skills/deploy-orca-relay/SKILL.md` first (or run both skills in order: deploy VPS → this skill).

## What agents must get right

1. **Three process layers**, not one:
   - runtime host: `orca serve` (or desktop Orca) + `orca-relay-bridge`
   - personal VPS: `orca-relay` behind TLS; optionally a **public** `orca-relay-proxy`
   - client side: either a **local** `orca-relay-proxy` (CLI/dev) **or** a pairing code whose `endpoint` already points at the public proxy (mobile / remote desktop)
2. **Pairing codes are secrets.** Never print full pairing URLs, `deviceToken`, or `publicKeyB64` into chat, commits, logs, or screenshots. Show only redacted forms such as `orca://pair?code=<redacted>` and the rewritten **endpoint** string.
3. **`ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN` is environment-only.** No `--token` flag exists on relay/proxy/bridge/installer.
4. **Current public `orca serve` CLI does not take relay flags and does not parent the bridge.** Supervise runtime and bridge as two processes. Do not invent `--serve-relay-*` flags unless the operator’s local Electron build actually exposes them.
5. **Scope matters:**
   - Desktop / web / remote-runtime clients → `scope=runtime` (default `orca serve` pairing)
   - Mobile app → `scope=mobile` (`orca serve --mobile-pairing`, or Settings → Mobile QR)
6. **Endpoint rewrite only changes reachability.** `orca-relay rewrite-pairing-code` rewrites `endpoint` and preserves credential fields. Opaque relay frames are **not** an encryption product.

## Interview first (do not guess)

Ask the operator and restated topology back before writing files or restarting services:

| Question | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Where does the Orca runtime run? (dev laptop, headless Linux box, desktop GUI) | Places `orca serve` + bridge |
| Runtime port? (common: `6768`) | Bridge `ORCA_RUNTIME_WS_URL` |
| Personal VPS SSH host + domain? | Relay public `wss://` |
| Is the VPS relay already healthy? | Gate before clients |
| Who will connect: Mobile, Mac desktop, Windows desktop, remote CLI, or all? | Chooses public proxy vs local proxy |
| One shared `serverId` for this runtime? | Must match bridge + every proxy |

Chosen identifiers (examples only):

```text
ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID=<server-id>          # routing id, not a secret
ORCA_RELAY_URL=wss://<your-relay-domain.example>/ws
ORCA_RUNTIME_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:<orca-runtime-port>/   # or .../ws if that is what the runtime prints
ORCA_PUBLIC_PROXY_ENDPOINT=wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws
```

Use one `serverId` per runtime. Give each public/local proxy its own `clientId`
(`mobile-public`, `macbook-cli`, `win-dev`, …).

## Topology cheat sheet

| Client | Recommended path | Pairing `endpoint` the client dials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mobile (iOS/Android)** | Public proxy on VPS | `wss://<public-proxy-or-mobile-domain>/ws` |
| **Mac / Windows Orca desktop** (away from runtime host) | Public proxy on VPS **or** local proxy on that Mac/Win machine | public `wss://.../ws` **or** local `ws://127.0.0.1:17777/ws` |
| **Remote Orca CLI** on a Linux box / CI host | Local `orca-relay-proxy` on the CLI host | rewritten `ws://127.0.0.1:17777/ws` |
| **Same LAN only** (no VPS) | No orca-relay needed | `ws://<runtime-lan-ip>:6768` from `orca serve --pairing-address <lan-ip>` |

If the user asked for “personal VPS pairing”, use the relay path, not LAN-only.

---

## Phase A — Development / runtime host: Orca server + bridge

### A1. Start the Orca runtime

**Headless Linux / dev server (preferred for always-on relay):**

```sh
# Install/run path is operator-specific: packaged AppImage, orca-ide, or dev orca-dev.
# Public flags that exist today:
orca serve --port <orca-runtime-port> --json
```

For clients that must reach through the personal VPS public proxy, advertise that
public WebSocket endpoint in the pairing offer:

```sh
# Runtime-scoped pairing for Mac/Win/desktop/web clients
orca serve \
  --port <orca-runtime-port> \
  --pairing-address 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' \
  --json

# Mobile-scoped pairing for the phone app
orca serve \
  --port <orca-runtime-port> \
  --pairing-address 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' \
  --mobile-pairing \
  --json
```

Notes:

- `--pairing-address` **only changes the advertised endpoint inside the pairing code**. It does not bind the public socket by itself.
- On headless hosts without `DISPLAY`, install `xvfb` first. Current Orca can auto-start Xvfb; otherwise run Xvfb in tmux and set `DISPLAY`.
- Ready output includes `pairing.url` / `Pairing URL: orca://pair?code=...`. Treat that string as secret. Persist it only in a root-only file such as `/root/.config/orca/orca-relay-pairing.txt` (mode `0600`).
- Desktop GUI alternative: open Orca → Settings → Mobile (mobile QR) or Settings runtime pairing generator (runtime URL). Still rewrite/advertise the public proxy endpoint when clients are off-LAN.

**Gate A1**

```sh
ss -ltn | grep '<orca-runtime-port>'
# optional: ORCA status --json  → running/ready/reachable when CLI is available
```

### A2. Start `orca-relay-bridge` next to the runtime

Persist non-chat secrets in an env file:

```sh
sudo install -d -m 0700 /root/.config/orca
sudo tee /root/.config/orca/orca-relay.env >/dev/null <<'EOF'
ORCA_RELAY_URL=wss://<your-relay-domain.example>/ws
ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID=<server-id>
ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN=<relay-token-from-secure-env>
ORCA_RUNTIME_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:<orca-runtime-port>/
EOF
sudo chmod 600 /root/.config/orca/orca-relay.env
```

Start the bridge (tmux example; systemd is also fine):

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s orca-relay-bridge \
  "set -a; source /root/.config/orca/orca-relay.env; set +a; \
   exec /opt/orca-relay/current/orca-relay-bridge \
     --relay-url \"\$ORCA_RELAY_URL\" \
     --runtime-url \"\$ORCA_RUNTIME_WS_URL\" \
     --server-id \"\$ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID\" \
     >>/tmp/orca-relay-bridge.log 2>&1"
```

**Gate A2**

```sh
pgrep -af orca-relay-bridge
# bridge should hold an established uplink to the VPS TLS port (usually :443)
ss -tnp | grep orca-relay-bridge | grep -E ':(443|8080)\b' || true
```

Close code `1013` / `local runtime unavailable` means bridge→runtime failed: fix
`ORCA_RUNTIME_WS_URL` or start `orca serve` first.

### A3. Optional local stability layer

Only after a client has paired once:

```sh
bash scripts/orca-relay-bridge-watchdog.sh --status --json
bash scripts/orca-relay-watchdog-daemon.sh start
```

This restarts local runtime/bridge only. It never restarts VPS proxies.

---

## Phase B — Personal VPS: relay (+ public proxy for Mobile/Mac/Win)

### B1. Relay service

If not already done, follow `skills/deploy-orca-relay/SKILL.md` Phase 1.

**Gate B1**

```sh
systemctl is-active orca-relay.service
curl -fsS 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/health'     # expect {"status":"ok"}
curl -fsS 'https://<your-relay-domain.example>/health'
ss -ltnp | grep 8080                         # must be 127.0.0.1, never 0.0.0.0
```

### B2. Public proxy on the VPS (recommended for Mobile / remote desktop)

Phones and remote Mac/Win desktops usually cannot run a private local proxy and
still need a stable `wss://` endpoint inside the pairing code. Run
`orca-relay-proxy` on the VPS and put it behind TLS.

Example unit shape (paths/names are operator-owned; keep secrets in env files):

```sh
# /etc/orca-relay/orca-relay-proxy-mobile.env  (mode 0600)
ORCA_RELAY_URL=wss://127.0.0.1:8080/ws
# If the proxy is on the same host as the relay and talks over loopback plain WS:
# ORCA_RELAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws
ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID=<server-id>
ORCA_RELAY_CLIENT_ID=mobile-public
ORCA_RELAY_BIND=127.0.0.1:17778
ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN=<relay-token-from-secure-env>
```

```sh
/opt/orca-relay/current/orca-relay-proxy \
  --bind '127.0.0.1:17778' \
  --relay-url "$ORCA_RELAY_URL" \
  --server-id "$ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID" \
  --client-id "$ORCA_RELAY_CLIENT_ID"
```

Caddy (or Nginx) should terminate TLS for `<your-public-proxy-domain.example>` and
reverse-proxy to `127.0.0.1:17778`. The public client endpoint becomes:

```text
wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws
```

That exact URL is what belongs in:

- `orca serve --pairing-address 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws'`
- or `orca-relay rewrite-pairing-code --endpoint 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' ...`

**Gate B2**

```sh
curl -fsS 'https://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/health'  # only if you expose /health there
# WebSocket upgrade smoke (expect HTTP/1.1 101 when path is correct):
curl --http1.1 -s -D- -o /dev/null --max-time 4 \
  -H 'Connection: Upgrade' -H 'Upgrade: websocket' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==' \
  'https://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' || true
```

You may reuse the same hostname for relay and public proxy only if reverse-proxy
routing is intentional and tested. When unsure, use two hostnames.

### B3. Shared token and matching selected runtime ID

| Process | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| `orca-relay` | `ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN` |
| every `orca-relay-proxy` | same token + default `serverId` + unique `clientId`; optional explicit extra IDs |
| each `orca-relay-bridge` | same token + its own selected `serverId` + runtime URL |

Optional one-proxy mode: set `ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_IDS='<server-id-b>,<server-id-c>'`
or `--server-ids` alongside the existing default `ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID`.
`/` and `/ws` keep the default target; `/r/<server-id>` and
`/r/<server-id>/ws` select a default or explicit additional ID on the same port.
Preserve these paths through the TLS reverse proxy and mobile pairing flow.
Use each runtime's own pairing offer and rewrite only its endpoint to its named
path, preserving every other field. Verify a real round trip for each target.
Omit the extra-ID variable when unused; blank entries and additional IDs equal to `.` or `..`, or containing path separators or control characters prevent startup. URL-encode
each ID as a single path segment. This config selects destinations; it does not
add per-runtime authorization. The proxy port has no authentication of its own,
so keep it on loopback or the intended VPN interface; each runtime validates its
own Orca pairing credentials.

Mismatch symptoms:

- `401` → token mismatch
- HTTP `404` on a named proxy route → ID not explicitly configured
- `503` / server absent → bridge down or `serverId` mismatch

---

## Phase C — Produce pairing codes (do not hand raw secrets to chat)

### C1. Generate on the runtime host

Prefer letting Orca mint the code, then rewrite only if the advertised endpoint is wrong.

```sh
# Capture ready JSON privately (operator machine), do not paste into agent chat.
orca serve --port <orca-runtime-port> \
  --pairing-address 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' \
  --json
# → pairing.url  (scope defaults to runtime)

orca serve --port <orca-runtime-port> \
  --pairing-address 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' \
  --mobile-pairing \
  --json
# → mobile-scoped pairing.url
```

If the minted endpoint still points at loopback/LAN, rewrite:

```sh
orca-relay rewrite-pairing-code \
  --endpoint 'wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws' \
  '<pairing-code-or-link>'
```

For a **local-proxy CLI** path instead:

```sh
orca-relay rewrite-pairing-code \
  --endpoint 'ws://127.0.0.1:17777/ws' \
  '<pairing-code-or-link>'
```

Accepted inputs: bare URL-safe base64 payload, `orca://pair?...`, or desktop browser URL with `#pairing=`.

**Gate C1** (operator-side checks, redacted):

- rewritten offer still parses
- `endpoint` equals the intended proxy URL
- `deviceToken` / `publicKeyB64` unchanged
- `scope` is `runtime` for desktop or `mobile` for the phone app

### C2. Deliver codes to humans safely

- Prefer operator-local files, password managers, or QR shown on a private screen.
- Agent messages should say “pairing file updated on host path …” rather than dump the code.
- Rotate by minting a new offer on the runtime if a code may have leaked.

---

## Phase D — Client usage by platform

### D1. Mobile (iOS / Android)

1. Install Orca mobile (App Store / TestFlight / Android APK as the operator already uses).
2. Ensure Phase A+B are green and a **mobile-scoped** pairing code exists whose `endpoint` is the **public proxy** `wss://.../ws`.
3. In the app: scan the QR **or** paste the `orca://pair?code=...` / bare code.
4. Confirm the host entry’s endpoint is the public `wss://` proxy, not `ws://127.0.0.1:6768`.
5. Open a worktree/session and send a trivial follow-up to prove the RPC path.

LAN-only mobile debugging (no VPS) is different: same Wi-Fi, `ws://<desktop-lan-ip>:6768`, Android emulator often `ws://10.0.2.2:6768`. That path does **not** exercise orca-relay.

**Gate D1:** phone lists the host as connected and can read live terminal output.

### D2. macOS desktop Orca

1. Install/open Orca desktop on the Mac.
2. Use a **runtime-scoped** pairing URL.
3. If the Mac is off-LAN relative to the runtime host:
   - **Preferred:** pairing `endpoint` = public proxy `wss://<your-public-proxy-domain.example>/ws`
   - **Alt:** run local `orca-relay-proxy` on the Mac and rewrite endpoint to `ws://127.0.0.1:17777/ws`
4. Paste the pairing URL into the Orca client connect/pair UI (Settings runtime pairing / connect flow as shown by that build).
5. Verify worktrees/terminals from the remote runtime appear.

Local proxy on Mac (alt path):

```sh
export ORCA_RELAY_URL='wss://<your-relay-domain.example>/ws'
export ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID='<server-id>'
export ORCA_RELAY_CLIENT_ID='mac-desktop-1'
export ORCA_RELAY_BIND='127.0.0.1:17777'
export ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN='<relay-token-from-secure-env>'

orca-relay-proxy \
  --bind "$ORCA_RELAY_BIND" \
  --relay-url "$ORCA_RELAY_URL" \
  --server-id "$ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID" \
  --client-id "$ORCA_RELAY_CLIENT_ID"
```

### D3. Windows desktop Orca

Same contract as macOS:

1. Runtime-scoped pairing code.
2. Public proxy endpoint **or** local Windows `orca-relay-proxy` bound to `127.0.0.1:17777`.
3. Paste pairing URL into Orca Windows client.
4. Keep `ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN` in user env / private env file; never as a CLI flag.

If only a Linux musl release binary is published, build `orca-relay-proxy` from source on Windows or run the proxy on WSL and point the rewritten endpoint at that WSL localhost forward. Do not invent a fake download URL.

### D4. Remote Orca CLI (any OS shell that uses pairing/runtime WS)

```sh
# 1) local proxy on the CLI machine
orca-relay-proxy --bind '127.0.0.1:17777' \
  --relay-url 'wss://<your-relay-domain.example>/ws' \
  --server-id '<server-id>' \
  --client-id '<client-id>'

# 2) rewrite pairing endpoint to the local proxy
orca-relay rewrite-pairing-code \
  --endpoint 'ws://127.0.0.1:17777/ws' \
  '<pairing-code-or-link>'

# 3) feed the rewritten code to the Orca client/CLI pairing flow the operator uses
```

**Gate D4:** one real CLI round trip (status / worktree list / terminal read), not only `/health`.

---

## Phase E — Agent checklist (copy into the session plan)

Work top-down. Stop at the first failed gate.

- [ ] **Runtime listening** on `<orca-runtime-port>`
- [ ] **Bridge connected** to VPS with matching `serverId` + token
- [ ] **VPS relay** loopback `/health` OK and public `https://.../health` OK
- [ ] **Public proxy** (if Mobile/Mac/Win remote) listening on loopback and TLS path upgrades WebSocket
- [ ] **Pairing offer** has correct `scope` and `endpoint`
- [ ] **Client paired** without pasting secrets into chat
- [ ] **One real session action** succeeded (mobile follow-up, desktop terminal, or CLI JSON call)
- [ ] Optional: watchdog daemon on runtime host

Report exactly which gates ran and what they proved. Green `/health` alone never proves a paired Orca session.

---

## Failure → fix (client-focused)

| Symptom | Likely layer | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile scans QR but cannot connect | Pairing endpoint / public proxy | Endpoint must be public `wss://.../ws` reachable from the phone network |
| Desktop pairs then idles | Bridge or runtime | Bridge log + `ss` on runtime port; check close `1013` |
| CLI gets 503 through proxy | No bridge for `serverId` | Start bridge; align `ORCA_RELAY_SERVER_ID` |
| CLI gets 401 | Token | Same `ORCA_RELAY_TOKEN` on relay, proxy, bridge |
| Pairing rewrite fails | Payload shape | Need version `2` offer with `endpoint`, `deviceToken`, `publicKeyB64` |
| Phone works on LAN, fails on cellular | Still advertising LAN IP | Re-mint with public proxy endpoint |
| Processes healthy, clients hang | Soft death | `scripts/orca-relay-soft-death-probe.sh --once --json` |
| Agent prints secrets | Process error | Redact; rotate token and re-mint pairing offers |

---

## Rules you must not break

- Do not claim multi-tenant auth, per-client tokens, token expiry, mTLS, payload encryption, or Orca RPC inspection.
- Do not pass relay tokens as CLI flags.
- Do not commit env files that contain real tokens or pairing URLs.
- Do not tell users to modify the Orca app bundle; orca-relay is an external adapter.
- Keep the Rust relay on loopback; only TLS reverse proxies face the internet.
- When both this skill and `deploy-orca-relay` apply, install/verify the VPS first, then runtime/bridge, then clients.
